# Palindrome Linked List

## Task Description
Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to determine whether the linked list is a palindrome or not.

## Approach and Algorithm
To solve this problem, I will use the following approach:

1. Find the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list.
3. Compare the values of the nodes in the first half and the reversed second half of the linked list.

Steps in detail:
1. Initialize two pointers `slow` and `fast` to the head of the linked list.
2. Use a while loop to find the middle of the linked list:
   - Move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps at a time.
3. After finding the middle, reverse the second half of the linked list using the following steps:
   - Initialize three pointers `prev`, `current`, and `next`.
   - Set `current` to the node following `slow`.
   - While `current` is not null, do the following:
     - Set `next` to the next node of `current`.
     - Update `current`'s next pointer to point to `prev`.
     - Move `prev` and `current` one step forward.
   - Update the next pointer of the node following `slow` to be null.
4. Compare the values of the nodes in the first half and the reversed second half of the linked list using two pointers:
   - Initialize two pointers `left` and `right`.
   - Set `left` to the head of the linked list and `right` to the node following `slow`.
   - While `right` is not null, compare the values of `left` and `right`:
     - If they are not equal, the linked list is not a palindrome.
     - Move `left` and `right` one step forward.
5. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, the linked list is a palindrome.

## Complexity Analysis
- Let `n` be the number of nodes in the linked list.
- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) since we iterate through the linked list twice: once to find the middle and once to compare the values.
- The space complexity is O(1) since we use a constant amount of extra space.
- In conclusion, this approach allows us to determine whether the linked list is a palindrome or not in O(n) time and O(1) space.
