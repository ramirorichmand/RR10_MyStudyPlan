## Longest Common Prefix

### Task Description
The task is to write a function that finds the longest common prefix string among an array of strings.

### Approach and Algorithm
To find the longest common prefix among an array of strings, we can iterate through the characters of the strings in parallel. We start comparing the characters at the same position in each string. If all characters at the current position are the same, we append the character to the common prefix. If any character is different, we stop and return the common prefix found so far.

1. Initialize an empty string `common_prefix` to store the common prefix.
2. If the input array `strs` is empty, return an empty string.
3. Iterate through the characters at the same position in each string until the shortest string is exhausted:
   - Initialize a variable `current_char` with the character at the current position in the first string.
   - For each string from the second to the last in the array:
     - If the current character position is greater than or equal to the length of the current string or the character at the current position is different from `current_char`, return the `common_prefix`.
   - Append `current_char` to the `common_prefix`.
4. After the iteration, return the `common_prefix`.

### Complexity Analysis
- Let `n` be the number of strings in the input array and `m` be the length of the shortest string.
- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n * m), where we iterate through all characters in the strings in the worst case.
- The space complexity is O(m), where `m` is the length of the common prefix string.
- In conclusion, the algorithm efficiently finds the longest common prefix among an array of strings by comparing characters at the same position in parallel. It has a time complexity proportional to the product of the number of strings and the length of the shortest string, making it a practical solution for the problem.
