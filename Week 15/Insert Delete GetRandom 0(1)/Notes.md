# Implementing Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

## Task Description
The task is to implement the `RandomizedSet` class, which should support the following operations:
- `RandomizedSet()`: Initializes the `RandomizedSet` object.
- `bool insert(int val)`: Inserts an item `val` into the set if not present. Returns `true` if the item was not present, `false` otherwise.
- `bool remove(int val)`: Removes an item `val` from the set if present. Returns `true` if the item was present, `false` otherwise.
- `int getRandom()`: Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the same probability of being returned.

The goal is to implement these functions in such a way that each function works in average O(1) time complexity.

## Approach
To achieve average O(1) time complexity for all operations, we can use a combination of a hash map and an array (or list). Here's a high-level overview of how we can implement each operation:

1. `insert(int val)`: We can use a hash map to store the mapping of each value to its index in the array. When inserting a new value, we check if it already exists in the hash map. If not, we add it to the end of the array and update its index in the hash map. This allows us to achieve O(1) average time complexity for insertion.

2. `remove(int val)`: To remove a value, we first check if it exists in the hash map. If it does, we can remove it from the array by swapping it with the last element of the array and then update the index of the last element in the hash map. This ensures that we maintain a contiguous array of elements without any gaps. Again, this operation has O(1) average time complexity.

3. `getRandom()`: To get a random element, we can generate a random index between 0 and the current size of the array and return the element at that index. This ensures that each element has an equal probability of being selected.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: 
  - `insert(int val)`: O(1) average time complexity.
  - `remove(int val)`: O(1) average time complexity.
  - `getRandom()`: O(1) time complexity.
- Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the set.

This approach allows us to achieve O(1) average time complexity for all operations, as required.

## Conclusion
The `RandomizedSet` class can be implemented efficiently using a combination of a hash map and an array, ensuring O(1) average time complexity for insertions, removals, and random element retrieval.
