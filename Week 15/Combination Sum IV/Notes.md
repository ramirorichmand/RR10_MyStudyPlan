# Combination Sum IV

## Task Description
Given an array of distinct integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, the task is to return the number of possible combinations that add up to the target.

## Approach and Algorithm
I would solve this problem using dynamic programming. Here's how I would approach it:

1. Initialize a list `dp` of size `target + 1` where `dp[i]` represents the number of combinations to reach the value `i`.

2. Initialize `dp[0]` to 1, as there is one way to reach the value 0 (by not selecting any element).

3. Iterate through values from 1 to `target`:

   a. For each value `i`, iterate through the elements of `nums`:
   
      i. If `i - num >= 0`, it means that selecting the element `num` can contribute to reaching the value `i`. In that case, add `dp[i - num]` to `dp[i]` to account for all possible combinations that include `num`.

4. After processing all values from 1 to `target`, the `dp[target]` will contain the total number of combinations to reach the target value.

5. Return `dp[target]` as the answer.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(target * nums.length) as we have nested loops.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(target) as we use a list of size `target + 1` to store the number of combinations for each value.

## Conclusion
This dynamic programming approach efficiently calculates the number of combinations to reach the target sum using elements from the `nums` array. It handles distinct integers and can handle inputs with up to 200 elements and a target value up to 1000. The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
