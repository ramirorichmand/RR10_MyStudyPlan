# Longest Repeating Character Replacement

## Task Description:
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, the task is to find the length of the longest substring containing the same letter that can be obtained after changing at most `k` characters in the string to any other uppercase English character.

## Approach and Algorithm:
To solve this problem, I will use the sliding window technique to find the length of the longest substring containing the same letter. The idea is to maintain a window of characters and keep track of the count of each character within the window. If the count of the most frequent character within the window plus `k` is greater than the size of the window, I will expand the window. Otherwise, I will shrink the window.

1. I will initialize variables `max_length` and `start` to keep track of the maximum length of the substring and the start index of the current window, respectively.
2. I will iterate through the string using a variable `end` as the end index of the current window:
   - I will increment the count of the character `s[end]` in a frequency dictionary.
   - I will calculate the length of the current window as `end - start + 1`.
   - If the difference between the length of the current window and the count of the most frequent character within the window is greater than `k`, I will increment the `start` index and decrement the count of the character at index `start` in the frequency dictionary.
   - I will update the `max_length` with the maximum of `max_length` and the current window length.
3. After completing the iteration, I will return `max_length` as the result.

The result will be the length of the longest substring containing the same letter that can be obtained after changing at most `k` characters in the string.

## Complexity Analysis:
- Let `n` be the length of the string `s`.
- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) because I iterate through the string once using the sliding window technique.
- The space complexity is O(26) or O(1), as the frequency dictionary stores the count of characters, and there are 26 uppercase English letters.
- In conclusion, the sliding window approach allows me to find the length of the longest substring containing the same letter that can be obtained after changing at most `k` characters in the string with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). The algorithm efficiently adjusts the window size based on character counts and the maximum allowed changes.
