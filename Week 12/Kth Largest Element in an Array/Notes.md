# Kth Largest Element in an Array

## Task Description
The task is to find the kth largest element in an integer array `nums`.

## Approach and Algorithm
To solve this problem, I will use the concept of the quickselect algorithm, which is a variation of the quicksort algorithm. The idea is to partition the array based on a pivot element, and if the pivot's index is equal to k, then we have found the kth largest element. Otherwise, we recursively partition the array in a way that the pivot's index moves closer to k.

1. Choose a pivot element from the array (for example, the last element).
2. Partition the array into two parts: elements greater than the pivot and elements smaller than the pivot.
3. If the pivot's index is equal to k, return the pivot element.
4. If the pivot's index is greater than k, recursively perform quickselect on the left part of the partition.
5. If the pivot's index is less than k, recursively perform quickselect on the right part of the partition.

## Complexity Analysis
- Let `n` be the length of the input array `nums`.
- The average time complexity of the quickselect algorithm is O(n), but in the worst case, it can be O(n^2). However, the algorithm has an expected linear-time complexity on average.
- The space complexity is O(1) as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.
- In conclusion, the quickselect algorithm efficiently finds the kth largest element in the array with an average time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
