# Add Two Numbers

## Task Description
Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, the task is to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. The digits of each number are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit.

## Approach and Algorithm
To solve this problem, I will simulate the process of adding two numbers digit by digit, taking care of carry values. We will iterate through both linked lists simultaneously, adding corresponding digits along with any carry value from the previous digit addition. If the sum of two digits and the carry value exceeds 9, we update the carry and add the remainder to the result. The iteration continues until both linked lists are processed. If there's any remaining carry value after the iteration, we add it as a new node to the result linked list.

1. Initialize a dummy node and a current node to keep track of the result linked list.
2. Initialize variables `carry` and `sum` to store carry value and sum of digits, both initially set to 0.
3. Iterate while at least one of the linked lists is not empty:
   - Calculate the sum of two digits from linked lists and the carry value.
   - Update `sum` and `carry` variables accordingly.
   - Add a new node with the remainder of the sum to the result linked list.
   - Move to the next nodes in both linked lists.
4. After the iteration, if there's any remaining carry, add a new node with its value to the result linked list.
5. Return the next node of the dummy node as the starting point of the resulting linked list.

## Complexity Analysis
- Let `n` be the length of the longer linked list.
- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), as we iterate through both linked lists once.
- The space complexity is O(n), as the resulting linked list can have at most `n + 1` nodes.
- In conclusion, the algorithm efficiently adds two numbers represented by linked lists, simulating digit addition and handling carry values. It iterates through both linked lists and constructs the resulting linked list in reverse order.
