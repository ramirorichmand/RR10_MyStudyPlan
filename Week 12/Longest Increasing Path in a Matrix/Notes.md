# Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

## Task Description
The task is to find the length of the longest increasing path in a given matrix.

## Approach and Algorithm
To solve this problem, I will use dynamic programming with memoization. The idea is to start from each cell in the matrix and perform a depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible increasing paths from that cell. During the DFS, I will keep track of the length of the increasing path from the current cell. I will also use a memoization table to store the lengths of the increasing paths starting from each cell so that I don't have to recompute them if I encounter the same cell again.

1. Initialize a memoization table to store the lengths of increasing paths starting from each cell.
2. Iterate through each cell in the matrix:
   - For each cell, perform a depth-first search to explore all possible increasing paths starting from that cell.
   - During the DFS, check the memoization table to see if the length of the increasing path from the current cell is already computed. If yes, use it; otherwise, compute it recursively.
   - Update the maximum length of increasing paths if needed.
3. After exploring all cells, return the maximum length of increasing paths.

## Complexity Analysis
- Let `m` be the number of rows and `n` be the number of columns in the matrix.
- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(m * n) as I perform DFS from each cell only once, and each cell is visited at most once.
- The space complexity is also O(m * n) as I use a memoization table to store the lengths of increasing paths for each cell.
- In conclusion, the dynamic programming approach with memoization efficiently finds the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix with a time complexity of O(m * n) and a space complexity of O(m * n).
