# Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). Your task is to evaluate the expression and return an integer that represents its value.

The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'. Each operand may be an integer or another expression. The division between two integers always truncates toward zero. There will not be any division by zero. The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in RPN.

## Approach and Algorithm

To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We'll iterate through each token in the input array and perform the following steps:

1. If the token is an operand (integer), push it onto the stack.
2. If the token is an operator, pop the top two elements from the stack, perform the corresponding operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
   - For addition, subtract the second element popped from the first element popped.
   - For subtraction, subtract the first element popped from the second element popped.
   - For multiplication, multiply the first element popped with the second element popped.
   - For division, divide the second element popped by the first element popped.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all tokens have been processed.
4. At the end, the stack will contain only one element, which is the result of the expression. Pop this element and return it as the final result.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of tokens in the input array. We iterate through each token once.

The space complexity is O(N) as well. In the worst case, if all tokens are operands, they will be stored in the stack.

## Conclusion

The "Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation" problem can be solved using a stack-based approach. By following the steps outlined above, one should be able to evaluate the RPN expression and obtain the desired result.

Remember to handle the operators correctly and perform the operations according to the RPN rules.
