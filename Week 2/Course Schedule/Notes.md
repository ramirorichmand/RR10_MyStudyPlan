# Course Schedule

## Problem Description

You are given the number of courses `numCourses` and an array `prerequisites` that indicates the prerequisites for each course. Each element `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` means that you must take course `bi` before you can take course `ai`.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to finish all the courses, i.e., there are no cycles in the course dependencies.

## Approach and Algorithm

To solve this problem, we can use a graph-based approach and perform a topological sort. Here are the steps:

1. Build an adjacency list representation of the courses and their prerequisites using the `prerequisites` array.
2. Initialize an array `visited` to keep track of the visited nodes.
3. Initialize an array `inDegree` to store the in-degree of each course. The in-degree of a course is the number of prerequisite courses it has.
4. Iterate through all the courses and their prerequisites, updating the in-degree array accordingly.
5. Create a queue and add all the courses with an in-degree of 0 to the queue.
6. While the queue is not empty, do the following:
   - Remove a course from the queue and mark it as visited.
   - Decrement the in-degree of all its neighboring courses.
   - If any neighboring course has an in-degree of 0, add it to the queue.
7. After the queue is empty, check if all the courses have been visited. If so, return true; otherwise, return false.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this approach is O(V + E), where V is the number of courses (vertices) and E is the number of prerequisites (edges). We visit each course and each prerequisite once.

The space complexity is O(V), where V is the number of courses. We use additional arrays to store the visited nodes and the in-degree of each course.

## Conclusion

The "Course Schedule" problem can be solved using a graph-based approach and topological sort. By following the steps outlined above, you should be able to determine if it is possible to finish all the courses without any cycles in the course dependencies.

Remember to handle the graph representation correctly and perform the topological sort to detect any cycles.
