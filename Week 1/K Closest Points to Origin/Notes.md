## Intuition
The problem asks us to find the k closest points to the origin in an array of points. To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue, which allows us to sort the points by their distance (or distance^2, the square root is not necessary) from the origin.

## Approach
1. Create a priority queue and add each point to it, along with its distance from the origin. The priority queue will use the distance as the key for comparison when sorting the points, so the smallest distances will be at the front of the queue.
2. Create an empty 2D array called res with k rows. This array will hold the k closest points.
3. While k is greater than 0, remove the point with the smallest distance from the priority queue using the poll() method. This point will be added to the res array at index k-1.
4. Decrement k.
5. Return the res array.

## Complexity

### Time complexity: O(n log k)
The time complexity of the program is O(n log k), where n is the number of points and k is the number of closest points to return. The program first calculates the sum of squares of the x and y coordinates for each point and adds the point to a priority queue, which maintains the k smallest sums. Then, it retrieves the k smallest sums from the priority queue and returns the corresponding points.

### Space complexity: O(k)
The space complexity of the program is O(k), because it needs to store the k closest points in an array and maintain the k smallest sums in a priority queue.
