# Subtree of Another Tree

## Task Description
Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, the task is to determine if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values as `subRoot`. If such a subtree exists, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## Approach and Algorithm
To check if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values as `subRoot`, I can use a recursive approach. Here's the approach:

1. Define a helper function `isSameTree` that takes two tree nodes as arguments and returns `true` if they are identical in structure and values.

2. In the `isSameTree` function:
   - If both nodes are `null`, return `true` because they are considered identical.
   - If one node is `null` and the other is not, return `false` because they cannot be identical.
   - If the values of the two nodes are not equal, return `false` because they are not identical.
   - Recursively call `isSameTree` on the left subtrees and right subtrees of the two nodes to check if their children are identical.

3. In the main function:
   - Traverse the `root` tree in a depth-first manner.
   - For each node in the `root` tree, call the `isSameTree` function with the current node as the first argument and `subRoot` as the second argument.
   - If `isSameTree` returns `true` for any node, return `true` because a subtree with the same structure and values as `subRoot` exists in the `root` tree.
   - If the loop completes without finding a matching subtree, return `false`.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(m * n), where `m` is the number of nodes in the `root` tree, and `n` is the number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree. In the worst case, we may need to compare every node in the `root` tree with the `subRoot` tree.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(max(m, n)) due to the depth of the recursion stack.

## Conclusion
This approach efficiently checks if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values as `subRoot`. It works for binary trees with up to 2000 nodes in the `root` tree and up to 1000 nodes in the `subRoot` tree.
