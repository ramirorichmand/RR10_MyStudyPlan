# Middle of the Linked List - Problem Solving Explanation

## Problem:
The problem is to find the middle node of a singly linked list. If there are two middle nodes, the second middle node should be returned.

## Approach and Algorithm:
To solve this problem, I used the following approach:

1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
2. Move `fast` pointer by two steps and `slow` pointer by one step at each iteration until `fast` reaches the end of the linked list.
   - This way, when `fast` reaches the end, `slow` would have moved to the middle of the linked list.
3. Return the node pointed by `slow` as the middle node.

## Complexity Analysis:
- The approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the linked list once.
- The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.

## Conclusion:
By using two pointers, one moving at twice the speed of the other, we can find the middle node of a linked list efficiently. The approach provides an optimal solution for the problem.
