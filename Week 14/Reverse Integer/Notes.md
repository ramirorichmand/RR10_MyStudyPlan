# Reverse Integer

## Task Description
Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, the task is to return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0.

## Approach and Algorithm
To reverse the digits of the integer `x`, the following approach can be used:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0. This variable will store the reversed integer.
2. Use a loop to extract the last digit of `x` in each iteration and add it to `result`.
3. To extract the last digit of `x`, use the modulo operation (`x % 10`) and then update `x` by dividing it by 10 (`x / 10`).
4. Before adding a new digit to `result`, check if adding it would cause an overflow (i.e., if `result` is greater than `INT_MAX / 10` or less than `INT_MIN / 10`). If an overflow is detected, return 0.
5. Continue this process until `x` becomes 0.
6. Finally, return `result`.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(log(x)), where x is the input integer. This is because we iterate through the digits of `x`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we use a constant amount of extra space.

## Conclusion
This approach efficiently reverses the digits of the integer `x` while handling overflow cases. It works for signed 32-bit integers within the specified range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1].
