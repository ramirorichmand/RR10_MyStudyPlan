# Subsets

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` of unique elements, you need to return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets, and the order of the subsets does not matter.

## Approach and Algorithm

To solve this problem, we can use the backtracking approach to generate all possible subsets.

1. We start with an empty list `current` to store the current subset being generated.
2. We initialize an empty list `result` to store all the subsets generated so far.
3. We define a helper function `generateSubsets` that takes three parameters: `start` (the index to start the subset generation), `current` (the current subset being generated), and `result` (the list of all subsets generated so far).
4. In the `generateSubsets` function:
   - We add the `current` subset to the `result` list.
   - We iterate through the remaining elements starting from the `start` index:
     - Add the current element to the `current` subset.
     - Recursively call the `generateSubsets` function with the `start` index incremented by 1.
     - Remove the current element from the `current` subset (backtrack).
5. Finally, we call the `generateSubsets` function with `start = 0`, an empty `current` subset, and the `result` list.
6. We return the `result` list, which contains all the subsets generated.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this approach is O(2^n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because for each element in `nums`, we have two choices: either include it in the subset or exclude it.
The space complexity is O(n) since we use additional space to store the `current` subset and the `result` list.

## Conclusion

The "Subsets" problem can be solved by using the backtracking approach to generate all possible subsets. By following the algorithm mentioned above, we can obtain all the subsets of the given array `nums`.
