# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Approach and Algorithm

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to calculate the maximum depth of the binary tree. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. If the root node is null, return 0 as the depth.
2. Recursively calculate the maximum depth of the left subtree by calling the function on the left child of the root.
3. Recursively calculate the maximum depth of the right subtree by calling the function on the right child of the root.
4. Return the maximum depth among the left and right subtrees plus 1 (to account for the root node).

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node once in the tree.

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the height of the tree can be equal to the number of nodes (H = N), resulting in O(N) space complexity for the recursive call stack. However, in a balanced binary tree, the height is log(N), leading to O(log(N)) space complexity.

## Conclusion

Using a recursive approach, we can find the maximum depth of a binary tree. By recursively calculating the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees, and considering the depth of the root node, we can determine the maximum depth of the entire tree. This algorithm provides an efficient solution to the problem, allowing us to traverse the tree and compute the maximum depth in a simple and concise manner.
