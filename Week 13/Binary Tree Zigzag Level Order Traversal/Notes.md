# Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

## Task Description
Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. Zigzag level order traversal means traversing the tree from left to right for the first level, then from right to left for the next level, and alternating between these directions.

## Approach and Algorithm
To solve this problem, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the binary tree level by level. During the BFS traversal, I will maintain a flag to indicate the traversal direction (left to right or right to left). At each level, I will reverse the order of nodes' values if the direction is right to left.

Here are the steps:

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the zigzag level order traversal.
2. Initialize a queue for the BFS traversal and add the root node to the queue.
3. Initialize a variable `left_to_right` as True, indicating the initial direction is left to right.
4. While the queue is not empty:
   - Initialize an empty list `current_level` to store the values of nodes in the current level.
   - Get the number of nodes in the current level (equal to the size of the queue).
   - Iterate through the nodes in the current level:
     - Pop a node from the queue.
     - Append the value of the node to `current_level`.
     - If `left_to_right` is False, reverse the order of values in `current_level`.
     - Add the left and right children of the node to the queue (if they exist).
   - Append `current_level` to `result`.
   - Toggle the value of `left_to_right` for the next level.
5. Return the `result` list containing the zigzag level order traversal.

## Complexity Analysis
- Let `n` be the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) because we visit each node once during the BFS traversal.
- The space complexity is O(n) as the maximum number of nodes at any level in the queue is n/2 in the worst case (for a complete binary tree).
- In conclusion, this approach efficiently computes the zigzag level order traversal of the binary tree with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).
