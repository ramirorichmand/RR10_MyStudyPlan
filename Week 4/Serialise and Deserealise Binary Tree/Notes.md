# Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

## Problem Description

In this problem, you are given a binary tree, and you need to design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize the tree. Serialization is the process of converting a data structure into a sequence of bits or characters so that it can be stored or transmitted, and deserialization is the reverse process of reconstructing the data structure from the serialized form.

## Approach and Algorithm

To solve this problem, you can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach.

### Serialization:

To serialize the binary tree, you can perform a pre-order traversal of the tree and store the node values in a string. Here's how you can approach it:

1. Start with an empty string.
2. Traverse the tree in pre-order.
   - If the current node is null, append a special character (such as '#') to the string.
   - If the current node is not null, append its value to the string, followed by a delimiter (such as ',').
   - Recursively serialize the left subtree.
   - Recursively serialize the right subtree.
3. Return the serialized string.

### Deserialization:

To deserialize the serialized string and reconstruct the binary tree, you can use a recursive approach. Here's how you can approach it:

1. Split the serialized string by the delimiter to get an array of node values.
2. initialise an index variable to keep track of the current node value.
3. Create a helper function that takes the array of node values and the index as input and returns a node.
   - If the current node value is '#', return null.
   - Otherwise, create a new node with the current value.
   - Increment the index to move to the next value in the array.
   - Recursively set the left child of the current node by calling the helper function with the array and the updated index.
   - Recursively set the right child of the current node by calling the helper function with the array and the updated index.
   - Return the current node.
4. Call the helper function with the array of node values and the index set to 0 to start the deserialization process.
5. Return the root node of the deserialized binary tree.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the serialization and deserialization processes is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because both processes involve visiting each node once.

The space complexity is O(N) as well, as we use additional space to store the serialized string or the array of node values.

## Conclusion

The "Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree" problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. By performing pre-order traversal and storing the node values, you can serialize the binary tree into a string. Similarly, by using recursion and the pre-order traversal order, you can deserialize the serialized string and reconstruct the original binary tree.

Remember to handle the edge cases, such as empty trees or null nodes, during both serialization and deserialization.
