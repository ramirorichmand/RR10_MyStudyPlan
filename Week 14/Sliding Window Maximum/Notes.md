# Sliding Window Maximum

## Task Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, a sliding window of size `k` is moved from the very left of the array to the very right. The task is to return the maximum value in the sliding window as it moves.

## Approach and Algorithm
To find the maximum sliding window efficiently, I can use a deque (double-ended queue) to maintain the indices of elements within the current window. Here's how I would approach this problem:

1. Initialize an empty deque `dq` to store the indices of elements within the current window.

2. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the maximum values for each window position.

3. Iterate through the array `nums` from left to right, and for each element `nums[i]`:
   - While the deque is not empty and the element at the back of the deque (nums[dq[-1]]) is less than or equal to `nums[i]`, pop the back element from the deque since it cannot be the maximum in the current window.
   - Append the index `i` to the back of the deque.

4. Check if the front element of the deque (nums[dq[0]]) is outside the current window (i.e., `i - dq[0] >= k`). If it is, remove the front element from the deque.

5. Append the maximum value in the current window (nums[dq[0]]) to the `result` list.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the entire array, and the `result` list will contain the maximum values for each window position.

7. Return the `result` list as the final answer.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. We iterate through the array once.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(k), as the deque can have at most `k` elements at any point in time.

## Conclusion
This approach efficiently finds the maximum values in the sliding window as it moves from left to right in the array. It works for arrays with up to 10^5 elements and values in the range [-10^4, 10^4].
