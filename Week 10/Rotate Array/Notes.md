# Rotate Array

## Task Description:
Given an integer array `nums`, the task is to rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

## Approach and Algorithm:
To solve this problem, I will explore multiple approaches to rotate the array.

### Approach 1: Using Extra Array
I will create an extra array of the same length as `nums`. I will copy the elements from `nums` to the extra array in the rotated order. Then, I will copy the elements from the extra array back to `nums`.

### Approach 2: Using Cyclic Replacements
I will rotate the array by performing cyclic replacements. Starting from the first element, I will keep swapping elements in a cycle until I complete a full rotation. I will keep track of the number of elements I have rotated so far and stop when I reach the total number of elements.

### Approach 3: Using Reverse
I will reverse the entire array. Then, I will reverse the first `k` elements and the remaining `n - k` elements separately. This will effectively rotate the array to the right by `k` steps.

### Approach 4: Using Block-Swap Algorithm
I will divide the array into two blocks: the first `n - k` elements and the last `k` elements. I will swap these two blocks to rotate the array.

## Complexity Analysis:
- Let `n` be the number of elements in the input array `nums` and `k` be the number of steps to rotate.
- Approach 1 has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) due to the use of an extra array.
- Approach 2, 3, and 4 have a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as they involve in-place operations.
- In conclusion, there are multiple ways to rotate the array in O(n) time complexity. Depending on the approach chosen, the space complexity can be O(1) or O(n). The problem can be solved using various techniques while maintaining the non-negative constraint of `k`.
