# Diameter of Binary Tree - Problem Solving Explanation

## Problem:
The problem is to find the length of the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. The path may or may not pass through the root.

## Approach and Algorithm:
To solve this problem, I used the following approach:

1. Define a recursive function `diameter` that calculates the length of the longest path starting from a given node:
   - If the node is null, return 0.
   - Recursively calculate the heights of the left and right subtrees using the `diameter` function.
   - Calculate the diameter passing through the current node as the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees plus 1 (for the current node).
   - Return the maximum diameter value among the three: diameter passing through the left subtree, diameter passing through the right subtree, and diameter passing through the current node.
2. Initialize a variable `maxDiameter` to store the maximum diameter encountered.
3. Start the recursive calculation of the diameter from the root of the binary tree.
4. Return the value stored in `maxDiameter`.

## Complexity Analysis:
- The time complexity of the approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, as we visit each node once during the recursive traversal.
- The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursive function calls on the call stack.

## Conclusion:
By recursively calculating the diameter of the binary tree, considering the heights of the left and right subtrees, we can find the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. The approach provides an efficient solution for the problem.
