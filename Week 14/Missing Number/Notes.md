# Missing Number

## Task Description
Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, the task is to return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

## Approach and Algorithm
To find the missing number in the array, I can use the XOR operation. Here's the approach:

1. Initialize a variable `missing` to 0. This will be used to track the missing number.
2. Iterate through the `nums` array and for each element, perform the XOR operation with the index. That is, for `nums[i]`, XOR it with `i`.
3. Also, XOR each index from 0 to `n`. This will account for the fact that the missing number should have been in the array.
4. After these XOR operations, the `missing` variable will hold the missing number.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We iterate through the array once and perform constant-time operations for each element.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space for the `missing` variable.

## Conclusion
This approach efficiently finds the missing number in the array with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. It works for arrays with up to 10^4 elements and distinct values in the range [0, n].
