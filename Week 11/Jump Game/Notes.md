# Jump Game

## Task Description
Given an integer array `nums`, the task is to determine whether it is possible to reach the last index of the array. Each element in the array represents the maximum jump length from that position.

## Approach and Algorithm
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start from the first position and keep track of the farthest index we can reach at each step. As we iterate through the array, we update the farthest index using the maximum of the current farthest index and the sum of the current index and its jump length. If at any point the current index is greater than the farthest index we can reach, we know that it's impossible to reach the last index, and we return `false`. Otherwise, if we successfully reach the last index or go beyond it, we return `true`.

1. Initialize a variable `farthest` to store the farthest index we can reach, initially set to 0.
2. Iterate through the array using a variable `i`:
   - If `i` is greater than `farthest`, return `false` since we cannot reach the last index.
   - Update `farthest` using the maximum of its current value and `i + nums[i]`.
3. After the iteration, if `farthest` is greater than or equal to the last index, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

## Complexity Analysis
- Let `n` be the length of the array `nums`.
- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), as we iterate through the array once.
- The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
- In conclusion, the algorithm efficiently determines whether it's possible to reach the last index of the array using a greedy approach. It iterates through the array, updating the farthest index we can reach, and returns `true` if we can reach the last index or `false` otherwise.
