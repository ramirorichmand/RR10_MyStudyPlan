# Partition Equal Subset Sum

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, you need to determine whether it is possible to partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal. If it is possible, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## Approach and Algorithm

To solve this problem, we can use the dynamic programming approach.

1. First, we calculate the total sum of all the elements in the `nums` array.
2. If the sum is odd, it is not possible to divide the array into two subsets with equal sums. In this case, we return `false`.
3. If the sum is even, we create a boolean 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (sum/2 + 1)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
   - `dp[i][j]` will be `true` if there is a subset of elements from the first `i` elements of the `nums` array that has a sum equal to `j`.
4. We initialize the first column of `dp` as `true` because we can always form a subset with sum `0` by not selecting any element.
5. For each element in the `nums` array, we iterate from `1` to `sum/2` and update `dp` as follows:
   - If the current element is greater than the current sum `j`, we copy the value from the cell above (`dp[i-1][j]`).
   - Otherwise, we check if either of the following conditions is true:
     - The subset that includes the current element (`nums[i-1]`) has a sum equal to `j - nums[i-1]` (`dp[i-1][j - nums[i-1]]`).
     - The subset that excludes the current element has a sum equal to `j` (`dp[i-1][j]`).
6. Finally, we return the value in the bottom-right cell of `dp`, which indicates whether it is possible to partition the array into two subsets with equal sums.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this approach is O(n * sum/2), where n is the length of the `nums` array and sum is the total sum of all the elements in the array. The space complexity is O(n * sum/2) as well.

## Conclusion

The "Partition Equal Subset Sum" problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming. By following the approach described above, we can determine whether it is possible to partition the array into two subsets with equal sums.
