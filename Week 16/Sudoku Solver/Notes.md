# Sudoku Solver

## Task Description
Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:
- Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
- Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
- Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

## Approach
To solve the Sudoku puzzle, we can use a backtracking algorithm. The steps involve trying out different possibilities for each empty cell until a valid solution is found. The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Find an empty cell.
2. Try each digit from 1 to 9 in the empty cell.
3. If a digit satisfies the Sudoku rules, move to the next empty cell.
4. If no digit works, backtrack to the previous empty cell and try a different digit.
5. Repeat the process until a valid solution is found.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(9^(n*n)), where n is the size of the Sudoku board. In the worst case, we might have to try 9 possibilities for each of the n^2 cells.
- Space Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the size of the Sudoku board. The space is used for recursive function calls on the stack.

## Conclusion
The backtracking algorithm efficiently solves the Sudoku puzzle by exploring possible solutions and backtracking when an invalid choice is made. The algorithm guarantees a valid solution that satisfies the Sudoku rules.
