# Same Tree

## Task Description
Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, the task is to determine whether they are the same or not. Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and have the same node values.

## Approach and Algorithm
To determine whether two binary trees are the same, we can perform a depth-first traversal of both trees simultaneously and compare the corresponding nodes. If at any point the nodes being compared have different values or one of them is `None` while the other is not, then the trees are not the same. Otherwise, we continue traversing both trees and comparing their nodes.

1. Start the traversal from the roots of both trees `p` and `q`.
2. If either `p` or `q` is `None`, compare if both are `None`, and return the result accordingly.
3. If the values of nodes `p` and `q` are not equal, return `False`.
4. Recur for the left subtree by calling the function recursively with `p.left` and `q.left`, and then for the right subtree with `p.right` and `q.right`.
5. Return the result of both recursive calls (logical AND).

By performing the above steps recursively, we traverse both trees simultaneously and check if they are the same.

## Complexity Analysis
- Let `n` be the number of nodes in the binary trees `p` and `q`.
- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) because we need to visit every node in both trees once.
- The space complexity is O(h), where `h` is the height of the trees. In the worst case, when the trees are completely unbalanced (e.g., one tree is a straight line), the space complexity becomes O(n) due to the recursion stack. However, in the average case, the space complexity is O(log n) for balanced trees.

In conclusion, the algorithm efficiently determines whether two binary trees are the same or not by performing a depth-first traversal and comparing corresponding nodes. It has a linear time complexity and uses recursion to traverse the trees.

This approach ensures an effective comparison of the structure and values of the binary trees to determine their equality.
