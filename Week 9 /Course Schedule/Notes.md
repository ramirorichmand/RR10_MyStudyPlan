# Course Schedule II

## Task Description:
Given the total number of courses `numCourses` and an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`, the task is to return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

## Approach and Algorithm:
To solve this problem, I will use a topological sorting algorithm, specifically Kahn's algorithm. The idea is to find a linear ordering of the courses such that for every prerequisite `[ai, bi]`, course `bi` comes before course `ai` in the ordering. If such an ordering exists, it means that all courses can be completed without violating any prerequisites.

I will start by creating two data structures:
1. An array `inDegree` of size `numCourses` to store the indegree (number of prerequisites) for each course.
2. An adjacency list `graph` to represent the directed graph where the nodes are the courses and the edges are the prerequisites.

I will initialize the `inDegree` array and the `graph` based on the input `prerequisites`. Then, I will create a queue to perform a BFS (breadth-first search) on the graph.

I will add all the courses with an indegree of 0 (no prerequisites) to the queue. Then, while the queue is not empty, I will remove a course from the queue, reduce the indegree of its neighbors in the graph, and add any course with an indegree of 0 to the queue. This process will continue until the queue is empty.

If, after the BFS, there are still courses with a non-zero indegree, it means there is a cycle in the graph, and it is impossible to finish all courses. Otherwise, the courses in the queue represent a valid ordering, and I will return that as the result.

## Complexity Analysis:
- Let `n` be the number of courses `numCourses` and `m` be the number of prerequisites in the input array.
- Building the `inDegree` array and the `graph` takes O(m) time and O(n + m) space.
- Performing the BFS (Kahn's algorithm) takes O(n + m) time and O(n) space for the queue and the final result.
- In conclusion, the topological sorting algorithm based on Kahn's algorithm can find the ordering of courses in O(n + m) time and O(n + m) space. If it is possible to finish all courses, the result will be the ordering of courses, and if it is impossible, the result will be an empty array.
