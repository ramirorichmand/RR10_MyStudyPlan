# Largest Number

## Task Description
Given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, arrange them in such a way that they form the largest possible number and return it as a string.

## Approach and Algorithm
To create the largest number, I will define a custom comparison function that compares two numbers as strings. The idea is to compare two numbers `a` and `b` by concatenating them in two ways: `ab` and `ba`, and then comparing the lexicographically smaller one. This custom comparison will ensure that the resulting number is the largest.

Here are the steps:

1. Convert all integers in `nums` to strings to facilitate string concatenation.

2. Define a custom comparison function `compare(a, b)`:
   - Return `a + b` if `a + b` is lexicographically greater than `b + a`.
   - Otherwise, return `b + a`.

3. Sort the strings in `nums` using the custom comparison function. This will arrange the numbers to form the largest number.

4. Concatenate the sorted strings to obtain the largest possible number.

5. Return the result as a string.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: The most time-consuming operation is the sorting step, which takes O(n log n) time, where `n` is the number of integers in `nums`.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) to store the string representations of numbers.

## Conclusion
This approach allows us to arrange the numbers in `nums` in such a way that they form the largest possible number. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(n).
