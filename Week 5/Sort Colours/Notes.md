# Sort Colors - Problem Solving Explanation

## Problem:
The problem is to sort an array of objects colored red, white, and blue, represented by the integers 0, 1, and 2 respectively. The goal is to rearrange the elements of the array in-place such that objects of the same color are adjacent and the colors appear in the order red, white, and blue.

## Approach and Algorithm:
One approach to solve this problem is to use the Dutch National Flag algorithm, also known as the 3-way partitioning algorithm. This algorithm partitions the array into three sections: elements less than the target color (0), elements equal to the target color (1), and elements greater than the target color (2).

We can initialize three pointers: low, mid, and high. The low pointer points to the beginning of the array, the mid pointer starts at the beginning, and the high pointer starts at the end of the array.

We iterate through the array while the mid pointer is less than or equal to the high pointer. At each step, we compare the element at the mid pointer with the target color:

- If the element is 0, we swap it with the element at the low pointer and increment both low and mid pointers.
- If the element is 1, we simply increment the mid pointer.
- If the element is 2, we swap it with the element at the high pointer and decrement the high pointer.

By doing so, we gradually partition the array into the desired order. Once the iteration is complete, the array will be sorted with the colors in the order red (0), white (1), and blue (2).

## Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: The algorithm performs a single pass through the array, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is O(1).

## Conclusion:
The problem of sorting colors can be efficiently solved using the Dutch National Flag algorithm, which partitions the array into three sections based on the target color. This algorithm allows us to sort the colors in-place with a one-pass traversal, making it an optimal solution for the problem.
