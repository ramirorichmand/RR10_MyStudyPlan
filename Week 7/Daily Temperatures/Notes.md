# Daily Temperatures

## Problem Description

The problem is to find the number of days you have to wait after each day to get a warmer temperature. Given an array of integers representing the daily temperatures, we need to return an array where each element represents the number of days you need to wait to find a warmer temperature. If there is no future day with a warmer temperature, the corresponding element in the array should be 0.

## Approach and Algorithm

One approach to solve this problem is to use a stack. We iterate through the temperatures from left to right. For each temperature, we compare it with the temperatures at the top of the stack. If the current temperature is higher than the temperature at the top of the stack, we have found a warmer day. We pop the temperature from the stack and update the corresponding result in the output array. We repeat this process until we find a temperature that is higher than the current temperature or the stack becomes empty.

At the end of the iteration, if there are any temperatures remaining in the stack, it means there is no future day with a higher temperature. We update the corresponding elements in the output array to 0.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the temperatures array. We perform a single pass through the array.

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the temperatures array. In the worst case, all the temperatures may be in increasing order, leading to a stack with n elements.

## Conclusion

By using a stack and iterating through the temperatures array, we can determine the number of days to wait for a warmer temperature efficiently. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).
