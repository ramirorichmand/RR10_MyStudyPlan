### Coding <!-- Interview --> Preparation Plan 
<!-- designed by [@ardulat](https://github.com/ardulat), revised by me. -->

This is my personal coding interview preparation plan that I hope to follow during the time frame. Many things were adopted from other interview prep guides, some were suggested by top KZ coders that I know. Everything was then customised according to my knowledge and experience.  <!-- Feel free to customise it for yourself. -->

**Time frame**: ~4 months (mid May - mid September)

**Goal**: at least 1 offer to a big tech company in Europe/US üßø

## Getting started üöÄ

If you would like to prepare for the coding interview, feel free to reuse this repo. I, personally, find it very useful to organise things like so and track what you have done so far.

### Installing üë®‚Äçüîß

To prepare for the coding interview using this repository, fork it, and clone the forked repo to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding-interview-prep.git
```

### Solving problems üß©

You may want to solve problems on your own without reusing my codes. To do so, just remove everything from **Problems** directory.

To count your solved problems, execute the following Shell command:

```
./count_solved
```
-->
## Background üìö

Plan is based on existing preparation guides:

  - **[Interview preparation guide bible from Sergey Makagonov]**
  - [List of Udacity courses developed with Google]
  - [Good guide on GitHub]
  <!--
  - [Another guide on GitHub (seems to be less powerful)] -->

To stay motivated during preparation:

  - [Programeme Instagram]
  - [Tushar Roy‚Äôs YouTube Channel] - suggested by Alibek Datbayev
  - [CS Dojo's YouTube Channel]
  - [HackerRank's Youtube Channel]
  - Find someone who is also preparing for interviews and discuss problems together - suggested by Yerzhan Mademikhanov
  - Mock interview each other - suggested by Sherzat Aitbayev

## Overview üëÄ

**The areas I know:**
- Software Development - Back-end & Front-end
- SQL - Data Analysis

<!--
   - Back-end software development - Django MVC/REST, asynchronous Tornado, Play for Java, JAX-RS
   - Machine Learning - built language models with RNNs
   - iOS Development - 1 year experience (long ago, probably forgot)
-->
   
**The areas I need to work on:**
   - **Algorithms & Data Structures (Stacks, Queues, Graphs, Trees, etc.)** - 80% of time
   - Object-Oriented Programming (in Java)
   - System Design (Scalability :smirk:)
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Computer Architecture (Cache, RAM, etc.) - *review the course at NU*
   - Operating Systems (Processes and Threads, Scheduling) - *review the course at NU*
   - Computer Networks (especially TCP/IP) - *review the course at NU*

## Plan üìù

I have decided to split my plan into two phases (three months each): summer and autumn phases.

### First phase: Summer Time üèù

**Time to dedicate:**
   - 10 hrs on weekdays, 2 hours on weekends
   - 8 weeks
   - Total: ( 10 + 4 ) x 8 = 112 hrs 

**Objective:** solve > 200 problems on Leetcode! :sunglasses:

**Programming language chosen:** Java

**Areas to work on:**
   - Algorithms (e.g. sorting)
   - Data Structures (e.g. lists, stacks, queues, hash-map)
   - Graphs (e.g. BFS, DFS)
   - Trees (e.g. BST)
   - Object-Oriented Programming (in C++)
   - Dynamic Programming
   - **Mock Interviews - once a month**
   
**Where to study:**
   - [*Programming Challenges* by Steven Skiena] - first 3 chapters (theory only)
   - [LeetCode] - start from easy Facebook, LinkedIn, Uber, AirBnb, then focus on middle and hard problems
   - [InterviewBit] - go for another theory from video lectures and problems
   - [HackerRank], [Codeforces] - if time left for contests (to keep being interested in solving problems)
   - [Codefights] - suggested by Anuar Serikov
   - [Algorithm Design Canvas] - general guides on how to solve algo problems
   - [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) - fun practice in own time
 
**Comments:**
   - Push solved problems to Github for later usage to refresh memory

### Second Phase: Autumn Term üçÇ

**Time to dedicate:**
   - TBD but less than previous phase due to other commitments
   - 10 hrs on weekdays, 2 hours on weekends
   - 8 weeks
   - Total: ( 10 + 4 ) x 8 = 112 hrs, total: 224 hours (*be realistic, 200 hrs will be good too* :wink:)

**Objective:** solve 100 more Leetcode problems! :sunglasses:

**Areas to work on:**
   - Computer Architecture (Cache, RAM, etc.)
   - Operating Systems (Processes and Threads, Scheduling)
   - Computer Networks (especially TCP/IP)
   - System Design (Scalability uuh, cool)
   - **Mock Interviews - once a week (on weekends)**
   - Keep solving [LeetCode] problems + [*Cracking the Coding Interview*]

   
**Where to study:**
   - [*Computer Organization and Design* by David Patterson]
   - [*Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* by Jim Kurose]
   - GitHub repos mentioned above
   - **Everything listed in Sergey‚Äôs post (MUST!!!)**
   - [Pramp] - suggested by Yerzhan Mademikhanov (20 unique free interviews)
   - [Gainlo] - wanna pay?
   - [Distributed Systems] - **highly recommended** by Alibek Datbayev
   - Watch past interviews of people on [Glassdoor], [CareerCup] - suggested by Ulugbek Adilbekov

## Extra Time ‚è∞

Everything listed here is optional. Even though it is not that realistic to dedicate time to all these, I will try doing it during rest time at leisure :smile:

**Read Books:**
   - [*The Mythical Man-Month* by Brooks]
   - [*Inside the Black Box: The Simple Truth About Quantitative Trading*]

**Develop own website/landing page:**
   - [Yenbekbay.me] (source code is starred on Github)
   - [Sarahlim.com]

**Improve existing codes:**
   - [Software Engineering course project]
   - [Data Mining course project] - building financial models (use Siraj Raval‚Äôs example code)

**Complete started courses:**
   - [Python for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Interviews!]
   - [Machine Learning]
   
**Open Source projects to contribute:**
   - [QuantLib: the free/open-source library for quantitative finance]

**Physical:**
   - Buy a whiteboard/glassboard, put it in front of a mirror - *good investment*
