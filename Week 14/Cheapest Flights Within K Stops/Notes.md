# Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

## Task Description
Given a list of flights, each represented as [fromi, toi, pricei], and three integers src, dst, and k, the task is to find the cheapest price to travel from src to dst with at most k stops. If such a route is not possible, return -1.

## Approach and Algorithm
To solve this problem, we can use a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's the approach:

1. Initialize a dictionary `graph` to represent the flights. The keys will be the source cities, and the values will be lists of tuples containing the destination city and the price.
2. Create a priority queue (min-heap) to store the cities to visit. Initialize it with (0, src, k+1), where 0 is the total cost, src is the source city, and k+1 is the number of stops allowed.
3. Initialize a while loop to process cities from the priority queue while it's not empty.
   - Pop the city with the lowest cost from the priority queue.
   - If the popped city is the destination (dst), return its cost.
   - If the number of stops is greater than 0, iterate through the neighboring cities of the popped city.
   - For each neighboring city, calculate the total cost to reach it and add it to the priority queue if it's cheaper than the previous cost.
4. If the loop completes without finding a valid route, return -1.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(E + V * log(V)), where E is the number of flights and V is the number of cities. In the worst case, all cities will be added to the priority queue, resulting in O(V * log(V)) operations.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(V), as we store information about the cities in the priority queue and the graph.

## Conclusion
This approach efficiently finds the cheapest price to travel from src to dst with at most k stops. It works for a reasonable number of cities and flights, as specified in the constraints.
